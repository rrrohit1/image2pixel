This Python application extracts pixel values from images and normalizes them to the range [0, 1]. It supports both grayscale and RGB images. For grayscale images, it extracts a single intensity value per pixel, while for RGB images, it extracts and normalizes the three RGB values per pixel.

## Features

- Extract and normalize pixel values from images.
- Support for both grayscale and RGB images.
- Outputs a NumPy array containing the normalized pixel values.
